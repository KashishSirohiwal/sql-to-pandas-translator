## Features
- Run SQL-style queries directly on Pandas DataFrames  
- Supports major SQL clauses:  
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `AND` / `OR`  
  - `BETWEEN` (numeric + date ranges)  
  - `IN (...)`  
  - `ORDER BY col ASC|DESC`  
  - `DISTINCT`  
  - `GROUP BY` + aggregates (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)  
  - `HAVING`  
  - `LIMIT`  
- Auto-generates Markdown report (`query_results.md`) with query outputs

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone & Setup

git clone https://github.com/KashishSirohiwal/sql-to-pandas-translator.git<br>
cd sql-to-pandas-translator

```# create environment ```<br>
python -m venv .venv<br>
.\.venv\Scripts\activate     ```# Windows```<br>
```# or source .venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)```<br>
<br>
```# install dependencies```<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>

### 2. Run Queries

python test_queries.py<br>
```# This will execute all sample queries and save their outputs in query_results.md.```<br>

### 3. Use in Code

from src.sql_to_pandas import sql_to_pandas_select<br>
<br>
df = sql_to_pandas_select(<br>
    "SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY category HAVING SUM(amount) > 2000"<br>
)<br>
print(df)<br>

---

## Supported SQL Syntax

```-- Select all ```<br>
SELECT * FROM sales;

```-- Select columns ```<br>
SELECT product, amount FROM sales;

```-- WHERE with logical conditions ```<br>
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE city == 'Delhi' AND amount > 500;

```-- BETWEEN (numeric & date ranges)``` <br>
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE amount BETWEEN 100 AND 1000; <br>
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-02-01' AND '2023-03-31';

```-- IN ``` <br>
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE city IN ('Delhi','Noida'); <br>
SELECT product, amount FROM sales WHERE category IN ('Clothing','Stationery');

```-- ORDER BY ``` <br>
SELECT * FROM sales ORDER BY amount DESC;

```-- DISTINCT ```<br>
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM sales;

```-- GROUP BY + HAVING``` <br>
SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY category; <br>
SELECT city, COUNT(order_id) FROM sales GROUP BY city HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 2;

```-- LIMIT ```<br>
SELECT * FROM sales LIMIT 5;

---
## Sample Outputs

Results are auto-exported to query_results.md <br>
Hereâ€™s a preview:<br>
<br>
**SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM sales GROUP BY category**
```
category	     SUM(amount)
Clothing	       3097
Stationery	   	    75 
Toiletries    	   2890
```

---
## Limitations

This is a learning project, so some SQL features are not yet supported: <br>

-- JOINs & subqueries <br>
-- Aliases (AS) <br>
-- LIKE / regex filters <br>
-- Multiple aggregates in a single query <br>

---
## Future Improvements

-- JOIN support across multiple CSVs <br>
-- Aliases (AS total_sales) <br>
-- LIKE / pattern matching <br>
-- Support multiple aggregates per query <br>
-- Enhanced error handling <br>
